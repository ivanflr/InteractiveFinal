        <p>For most Americans, deportation is a passing event. They might hear about an undocumented community member being detained, or maybe their workplace gets raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A deportation might even make the local news
          or gain national attention. People may celebrate at that sight of a deportation or ICE raid, or may shake their heads in sorrow. Either way, it fades quickly from memory. But for the estimated <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html”>11 million undocumented immigrants</a>          living in the United States, the threat and fear of deportation is something that follows them around their entire lives. It does not begin when someone comes into contact with ICE, nor does it end when they get their day in immigration court.</p>

        <p><b>Living in fear of deportation</b> will attempt to give a window into three of the countless aspects of life for those who are undocumented, from childhood, to detention, to the courtroom. .

        <H2>INTERECTIVE II</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>The immigrant taking sanctuary from deportation in church has become an american icon, a sign of the times we live in. It’s a well known fact that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers do not go in churches. The document that makes
          this possible is known as the <a href=”https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ero-outreach/pdf/10029.2-policy.pdf”>sensitive locations memo.</a> Signed in 2011 by John Morton, former President Barack Obama’s first ICE director, the memo outlines where and
          when immigration officers can carry out enforcement actions like questionings, searches, surveillance, and detention. Besides houses of worship, other “sensitive locations” include schools, hospitals, funerals or weddings, and public gatherings
          like parades and protests.</p>
        <p>Reverend Seth Kaper-Dale is extremely familiar with this memo. The Reformed Church of Highland Park in New Jersey, which he has resided over since 2001, has hosted countless immigrants seeking sanctuary from deportation. “I knew I needed to be
          involved in the sanctuary movement starting in 2012, and this was after 10 years of working with the federal government to try to protect the indonesian christian population that happened to be part of my church,” he said. The sensitive locations
          memo has no actual legal power and, if you listen to Kaper-Dale, some ICE officers either treat the rules it contains as malleable guidelines or disregard them completely.

        <p>THe has countless stories of his parishioners being detained or surveilled near their kids schools, or even at his own church. AUDIO Fears about ICE doing away with it’s sensitive locations policy and conducting detentions everywhere and anywhere
          are compounded by the fact that the agency only recently started carrying out enforcement in courthouses.</p>
        <p>They <a href=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-ice-plans-courthouse-arrests-20180131-story.html”>formalized this policy</a>in February of 2018. Though the disappearance of sanctuary would be disastrous for Kaper-Dale’s
          parishioners, he says the status quo is unsustainable, and wants the federal government to work towards a permanent solution. “Sanctuary is sexy for about one week, and then no one remembers that sanctuary is going on, and it’s very hard to
          keep the public interest, and the people who languish here feel really trapped,” he said.

        <H2>New York Immigration Judges' Records May Foreshadow Outcome of Asylum Cases</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Everyday several hundred U.S. immigration judges hear cases that forever shape the life of people who are struggling to avoid deportation or to gain asylum. Some people might have to wait years to get their hearing as judges face a backlog of
          more than 650,000 cases.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department is accelerating the hiring of judges to chip away at the record backlog. But advocates and experts worry the additional judges brought on board under this administration will come from strong prosecutorial backgrounds, which
          could mean more deportations. “They were quite often prosecutors for the Department of Homeland Security,” said Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, associate professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. </p>
        <p>“When you grow up as a lawyer in a particular institution and your job is to identify who is removable from the United States, and then you get a case with that goal in mind, it’s hard to remove yourself wholly from that perspective.” Explore
          the interactive below, which shows current 34 New York judges and their track record on asylum cases. The more the gavel's head is shaded, the higher the risk of being denied asylum if you face that judge. Filter the interactive by where the
          judges are located in New York state.</p>
