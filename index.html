        <p>For most Americans, deportation is a passing event. They might hear about an undocumented community member being detained, or maybe their workplace gets raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A deportation might even make the local news
          or gain national attention. People may celebrate at that sight of a deportation or ICE raid, or may shake their heads in sorrow.</p>

        <p>Either way, it fades quickly from memory. But for the estimated <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html”>11 million undocumented immigrants</a> living in the United States, the threat
          and fear of deportation is something that follows them around their entire lives. It does not begin when someone comes into contact with ICE, nor does it end when they get their day in immigration court.</p>

        <p><b>Living in fear of deportation</b> will attempt to give a window into three of the countless aspects of life for those who are undocumented, from childhood, to detention, to the courtroom. .

        <H2>Young Lives at Stake:
How prolonged fear of deportation in childhood can affect your health forever
</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Imagine your father gets a note from INS and leaves the door unlocked, with the intention of returning, only to be hauled to a detention facility for two years.</p>

          <p>Your mother isn’t in the country and the closest relative you have is almost 3,000 miles away. Your life is uprooted from the sunny bay area to the hard hitting streets of New York. You’re 16 and everything you know has been shifted on its head.</p>

          <p>This is just one example of the stress that a child can encounter at the hands of deportation and it can have long lasting effects.
          </p>
          <p>"We refer to this kind of strain as toxic stress," said Emily Bosk, professor of social work at Rutgers University. "And it really changes kids’ brains."</p>

          <p>Living in fear of deportation is taking a psychological toll on New York City's immigrant communities, and it is getting worse.</p>

          <p>"The level of anxiety was enormous after the election," said George Finger, a coordinator at the Staten Island non-profit El Centro del Inmigrante, which provides social services for local immigrants. “Initially people didn’t want to leave their
            house.”
          </p>

          <p>Stress in childhood is uniquely virulent in its potential to alter health outcomes throughout the lifespan. Childhood trauma has been linked to health problems in adulthood, ranging from major depression to stroke.</p>



          <p>Based on our background research, none of the current clinical tools for measuring childhood trauma include specific questions about the effect of deportation, future health and quality of life.</p>

          <p>We created a survey of common deportation-related scenarios that do not appear in any commonly used diagnostic tests in order to help clinicians and the general population quantify the toll current deportation policy takes on children.

        <p>Bosk says prolonged exposure to challenging events can lead to changes to their adrenaline and cortisol metabolism, in turn altering their still-developing nervous systems.</p>

        <p>The Centers for Disease Control landmark study on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) developed a retrospective survey of adults to measure the impact of childhood trauma on medical conditions in adulthood.</p>

        <p>Researchers found that for every traumatic event or period of toxic stress a child endures, the higher his or her risk for many chronic and catastrophic medical conditions becomes.</p>

        <p>Results of the study have been consistently reproduced internationally over the nearly 20 years since it was published. The simple survey at the heart of the research is considered the gold standard for quantifying the health costs from developmental
          trauma.
        </p>

        <p>The questions in our survey are similar in nature to items on the CDC’s Adverse Childhood Experiences survey, so we assigned them a value based on datasets from previous studies in peer-reviewed medical journals with statistically significant
          sample sizes.</p>

        <p>Our survey provides someone who has no idea what it is like to live in fear of deportation a way to imagine the weight of the constant threat and its damaging effects on children in particular.</p>

        <p>The survey is also a jumping off point for clinicians and policy makers who are looking for a way to quantify the health impact of today’s climate of fear. A method for gathering specific numeric data could help the medical and social work fields
          to secure financial support for interventions that could help affected families.</p>

        <p>"We do have really good practices and models for children and families," said Emily Bosk. "they are just not very well utilized and not well funded."</p>


        <p>Dr. Bosk says that numbers can also be helpful for drafting legislation that might prevent some childhood trauma.</p>

        <p>"Good, strong policy can really mitigate some of these experiences we’re talking about.”</p>

        <H2>Between Policy and Practice; ICE's Sensitive Location Policy</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>The immigrant taking sanctuary from deportation in church has become an american icon, a sign of the times we live in. It’s a well known fact that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers do not go in churches. The document that makes
          this possible is known as the <a href=”https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ero-outreach/pdf/10029.2-policy.pdf”>sensitive locations memo.</a> Signed in 2011 by John Morton, former President Barack Obama’s first ICE director, the memo outlines where and
          when immigration officers can carry out enforcement actions like questionings, searches, surveillance, and detention. Besides houses of worship, other “sensitive locations” include schools, hospitals, funerals or weddings, and public gatherings
          like parades and protests.</p>


        <p>Reverend Seth Kaper-Dale is extremely familiar with this memo. The Reformed Church of Highland Park in New Jersey, which he has resided over since 2001, has hosted countless immigrants seeking sanctuary from deportation.</p>
        <p>“I knew I needed to be involved in the sanctuary movement starting in 2012, and this was after 10 years of working with the federal government to try to protect the indonesian christian population that happened to be part of my church,” he said.</p>

        <p>The sensitive locations memo has no actual legal power and, if you listen to Kaper-Dale, some ICE officers either treat the rules it contains as malleable guidelines or disregard them completely.</p>

        <p>Fears about ICE doing away with it’s sensitive locations policy and conducting detentions everywhere and anywhere are compounded by the fact that the agency only recently started carrying out enforcement in courthouses.</p>

          parishioners, he says the status quo is unsustainable, and wants the federal government to work towards a permanent solution.</p>
        <p>“Sanctuary is sexy for about one week, and then no one remembers that sanctuary is going on, and it’s very hard to keep the public interest, and the people who languish here feel really trapped,” he said.</p>

        <H2>New York Immigration Judges' Records May Foreshadow Outcome of Asylum Cases</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Everyday several hundred U.S. immigration judges hear cases that forever shape the life of people who are struggling to avoid deportation or to gain asylum. Some people might have to wait years to get their hearing as judges face a backlog of
          more than 650,000 cases.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department is accelerating the hiring of judges to chip away at the record backlog. But advocates and experts worry the additional judges brought on board under this administration will come from strong prosecutorial backgrounds, which
          could mean more deportations. “They were quite often prosecutors for the Department of Homeland Security,” said Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, associate professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. </p>

        <p><a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/490/include/denialrates.html">The data</a> was collected by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University and looks at a number of asylum cases presented to a judge between
          Fiscal Years 2012 and 2017. You can learn more about TRACS and how the data was collected <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/about.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Joselyn Castillo, 27, underwent the U.S. asylum process in 2015 after fleeing the violence she experienced as a trans woman in Guatemala.</p>

        <p>“A judge analyzes your case, but a judge doesn’t know what goes on back home,” said Castillo in Spanish. “Sometimes they say yes or no, but they have no idea what awaits in our home country, even death.”</p>

        <p>Castillo is one of more than 650,000 people in the U.S. whose fate depends on the decision of an immigration judge overseeing their case. “People apply for asylum when they don’t want to return to their countries because they know their lives
          are at risk,” Castillo said in Spanish.</p>

        <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in December the Department of Justice would hire 60 immigration judges by June 2018 to help reduce the backlog of immigration court cases. But only six judges have been hired so far, raising questions about
          how the backlog of immigration cases, like Castillo’s, will be handled.</p>

        <p>Some advocates and experts worry the additional judges brought on board under this administration will come from strong prosecutorial backgrounds, which could mean more deportations.</p>

        <p>Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, associate professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said some of the immigration judges currently on the bench do come from these types of backgrounds.</P>



        <p>The impact of judges’ professional backgrounds and track records has long played a role on the outcome of immigration and asylum cases, according to experts.</p>

        <p>Karen T. Grisez, representing the American Bar Association, said there needed to be improvements to the hiring process of immigration judges in general in a 2010 speech to a House subcommittee on immigration.</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vLwTj59.jpeg">

        <div class="container">

          <p>“There is a general lack of diversity in the professional backgrounds of judges, and there are problems with inappropriate judicial temperament,” said Grisez. “Some judges are hired with inadequate experience.”</P>

          <p>An additional problem is the growing backlog of immigration court cases, which affects the waiting time for people going through the courts and awaiting a decision about their future.</P>

          <p>The volume of cases and the complexity of each trial have contributed to this backlog of cases, which is estimated to be at a record-high of 657, 411. In New York alone, that number is almost 90,000 and there are only 34 immigration judges in
            the state to deal with the cases.</p>


          <p>“It’s not unusual for judges to be out two, three, or four years on their calendar,” said immigration judge A. Ashley Tabaddor of California who’s also President of the National Association of Immigration Judges, a voluntary organization dedicated
            to bettering immigration courts across the country. “Maybe somebody comes in and they get the preliminary issues done and now you want to set it for trial, many judges don’t have available trial dates until 2021.”</p>

          <p>“It’s not an easy process, it’s a long process,” said Castillo, who waited over two years for her asylum case to be heard and granted.</p>
