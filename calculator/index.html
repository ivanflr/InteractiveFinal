            Our Methodology:
            <p>
              We looked at studies measuring the impact of ACE score on various ailments: migraines, fetal death, depression, cancer, etc. For each illness that appears in our results, we used data from a particular study. These numbers are not predictions. They are
              based on numbers from other statistically representative populations. All of our data was taken from studies of statistically representative populations that have been published in peer reviewed medical journals since 2001.

          <p>
            Results of the study have been consistently reproduced internationally over the nearly 20 years since it was published. But while the simple survey at the heart of the research is considered the gold standard for quantifying the health costs from developmental
            trauma, it is not without its drawbacks.
          </p>

          <p>
            "While it is only probabilistic and not deterministic, the ACE is excellent at capturing the effects of many childhood traumas," said Dr. Bosk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Quantitative researchers, Bosk says, cannot provide reliable statistics for children living under the threat of deportation, the way they can for those living with other stressors such as various types of abuse and addiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without specific data, it is difficult for the medical and social work fields to test and secure financial support for interventions for children in need.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We do have really good practices and models for children and families," said Bosk. "they are just not very well utilized and not well funded."
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. Bosk says that numbers can also be helpful for drafting legislation that might prevent some childhood trauma.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Good, strong policy can really mitigate some of these experiences we’re talking about."
